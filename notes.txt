pip install Django
pip list

django-admin startproject projectname     -this to create django proj

copy the path and put in on pycharm as file open open the project country
then we need to add the environment we created as myenv

files->settings->project:countries -> python interpreter
then settings->add->existing env and select our myenv ->scripts ->python.exe

after this 
select terminal [from pycharm window]
python manage.py runserver  -this is to run server

then we will get a sever link

then go to any browser and type as
localhost:8000
